# AI-Powered Snake Game with Deep Q-Learning

This project implements a snake game using Deep Q-Learning (DQN), integrated with Pygame for the graphical interface and PyTorch for the reinforcement learning algorithm.

## Features

- **Deep Q-Learning Algorithm**: Utilizes PyTorch to implement the DQN algorithm for training the snake agent.
- **Pygame Interface**: Provides a graphical interface using Pygame for rendering the game environment and interacting with the user.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Implements reinforcement learning techniques to train the snake to maximize its score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Pygame
- PyTorch
